### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

wowie i found a secret

**Luna-Rex/luna-rex** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. (wow!!)

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on surviving a pandemic and making Godot games (if i havent updated this by mid-2021 i probably failed the first goal! if that's the case, give all of my socks to [Vamic](https://github.com/Vamic), he'll know what to do with them. he's the man with the plan.)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Godot
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on stuff where I get money for it, and also possibly things where I don't?? depends
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with most of the things I do, so feel free to offer it
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about video game soundtracks and I will tell you about a track I like.
